# Excel_Defect_Analysis

Touchpoint study for the analysis
There are 5 major touchpoints in the Line:
PM bulk unloading to the slab to stack.
Stacking of the Compact lids
Placing it in the pucker
Machine contact – Lid on – To close the lids
Machine contact – Pressure Belt

 Study -> Scratch Defects on the lids
 
Necessary Touchpoints and their reason:

PM bulk unloading – Due to harsh unloading of the Incoming PM number of scratches can increase.
Stacking manually – Due to the stacking of lids and placement on the table scratches can occur.
Machine Contact Lid On
Machine Contact Pressure Belt
 
With the above analysis, we could efficiently reduce the scratch defect percentage by changing the material of the Lead on the machine and Pressure belt.
